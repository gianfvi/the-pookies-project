# Vanguard UI A/B Testing Analysis 2017

## Overview
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the analysis of A/B testing conducted by Vanguard, one of the largest investment companies globally, in 2017. This project aimed to assess whether a newly proposed User Interface (UI) could enhance user completion rates, contributing to an overall better client experience. The repository contains datasets, analytical scripts, and visualization files used and generated during the study.

## Data Description
We utilized three key datasets to perform our analysis, each serving a distinct purpose in the investigation:
- **Client Profiles**: This dataset provided comprehensive demographic details of our clients such as age, gender, tenure with Vanguard, and account balances which are crucial for personalizing client interactions and understanding user behavior within different demographic segments.
- **Digital Footprints**: Contained data about the digital interactions of users within the UI, including visitor IDs and the sequences of steps taken by users. This dataset was instrumental in identifying patterns and bottlenecks in the UI flow.
- **Experiment Roster**: A critical dataset that classified clients into either the Test or Control group, allowing us to measure the effects of the new UI compared to the existing one.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the demographics and behavior of our client base:
- The **40-64 age group** emerged as the most significant demographic, suggesting a potential market segment for targeted product offerings.
- A gender disparity was noted in the younger demographics, with males predominating. This insight could direct targeted marketing strategies to balance engagement across genders.

## Key Performance Indicators
Our evaluation of the UI's performance was based on several key metrics:
- **Completion Rate**: This primary metric measured the percentage of users who completed their intended tasks within the new UI. An increase here indicates a more intuitive or user-friendly interface.
- **Bounce Rate**: We analyzed how often users exited the process prematurely, which helped identify pain points or confusing elements in the UI.
- **Error Rate**: Tracking errors encountered by users allowed us to pinpoint areas needing technical improvements.

## Results
Our analysis yielded positive results:
- The new UI demonstrated a **10% increase in completion rates**, which was double the initial improvement target set by Vanguard.
- Although the error rates were minimal, slight differences in bounce rates provided insights into user patience and interface navigability.

## Challenges and Learnings
Throughout this project, we encountered several challenges and learned valuable lessons:
- **GitHub Repository Management**: We experienced challenges with conflict resolution and consistent version control, especially when merging contributions from multiple collaborators.
- **Tableau Mastery**: Developing proficient skills in Tableau was challenging but ultimately rewarding, as it enabled us to create powerful visualizations that clearly communicated our findings.
- **Data Handling**: Correcting initial errors with identification numbers was a pivotal moment that taught us the importance of meticulous data verification.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The updated UI was a success in terms of both user engagement and meeting the cost-effectiveness thresholds set by Vanguard. Key recommendations include:
- **Design Focus**: Continue to design enhancements with a focus on the dominant 40-64 age group.
- **Youth Engagement**: Develop initiatives to attract a younger client base, such as collaborations with educational programs and tailored investment opportunities for young adults.
