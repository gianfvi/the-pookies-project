# Vanguard A/B Testing for New User Interface
## Overview
This repository contains the analysis of A/B testing conducted by Vanguard in 2017 to evaluate a new User Interface (UI) aimed at improving completion rates of user interactions. The primary question addressed was whether the new UI led to higher completion rates compared to the old one.

## Data Overview
The analysis utilized three main datasets:
1. **Client Profiles:** Contains demographics such as age, gender, tenure, and account balances.
2. **Digital Footprints:** Includes process steps and visitor IDs, crucial for identifying performance metrics.
3. **Experiment Roster:** Indicates whether clients were placed in the Test or Control group.
## Key Findings
- The demographic group aged 40-64 had the highest participation and account balances.
- A 10% increase in the completion rate was observed in the Test environment, surpassing the Vanguard's threshold of 5%.
- The data suggest that the redesign costs are justified by the improved completion rates.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis showed that:
- Both test and control environments maintained a balanced distribution of demographics.
- Error rates, bounce rates, and average durations per step were calculated to measure UI efficiency.
## Hypothesis Testing
- **Null Hypothesis:** No significant difference in completion rates between high and low balance accounts.
- **Chi-squared Test Results:** P-value = 0.7112, indicating that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
## Experiment Evaluation
- Duration: Three months
- Sample Size: 50,000 participants (Test - 26,968; Control - 23,532)
## Challenges and Learnings
- Managing the GitHub repository and resolving merge conflicts was challenging.
- Creating accurate KPI visualizations in Tableau required precise data manipulation.
## Conclusion and Recommendations
- **Conclusion:** The new UI was successful in improving completion rates and is cost-effective.
- **Recommendations for Vanguard:**
  - Focus further design improvements around the needs of the dominant age group (40-64).
  - Develop initiatives to attract and retain younger clients, such as partnerships with financial literacy programs for youth.
## Visualizations
- Visualizations of data were primarily made on Tableau.
