# Vanguard UI A/B Testing Analysis 2017

## Overview
This GitHub repository houses the analysis of the A/B testing conducted by Vanguard in 2017. The project aimed to evaluate the impact of a new User Interface (UI) on user completion rates. Here, you will find all relevant datasets, scripts, and visual outputs.

## Data Description
Our analysis is based on three primary datasets:
1. **Client Profiles:** Details on demographics such as age, gender, tenure, and account balances.
2. **Digital Footprints:** Tracks user activity through visitor IDs and steps taken within the UI.
3. **Experiment Roster:** Classifies clients into Test or Control groups to assess the new UI's performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We explored client demographics and behavior, discovering:
- The most significant demographic was the 40-64 age group.
- Gender disparities existed in younger demographics, with a predominance of males.

## Key Performance Indicators
Our assessment focused on:
- **Completion Rate:** The primary indicator of UI success.
- **Bounce Rate:** Helps identify early exits and potential UI issues.
- **Error Rate:** Monitors technical issues encountered by users.

## Results
The new UI demonstrated:
- A 10% increase in completion rates, exceeding Vanguard's target.
- Insights into user behavior through minimal error and variable bounce rates.

## Challenges and Learnings
Key challenges included:
- **GitHub Management:** Challenges with version control and merge conflicts.
- **Tableau Visualization:** Learning curve associated with mastering Tableau for effective data presentation.
- **Data Handling:** Importance of accurate data verification highlighted by initial ID mismatches.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The UI was successful in improving user engagement:
- **Design Focus:** Continue focusing on enhancements for the 40-64 age group.
- **Youth Engagement:** Initiatives to attract younger demographics are recommended.
